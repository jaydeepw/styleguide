## Styleguide

This repo contains styleguides for the UI/UX designs for all the products we build. Additionally it also includes the styleguide for applications developed in different languages/frameworks - javascript/node.js, python/django, .net/mvc framework, css/less.

You'll have to create a folder with html files to demo the UI/UX stuff and then publish this as github pages.
